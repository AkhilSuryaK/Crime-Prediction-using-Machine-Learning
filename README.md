🚨 Crime Rate Prediction - Unlock Safety: Reduce Crime Rate Together
Crime Rate Predictor is an application that uses machine learning techniques to predict crime rates in 19 Indian metropolitan cities. The goal of this project is to assist law enforcement agencies in understanding crime patterns and allocating resources effectively to reduce crime rates and improve public safety.

🧠 About the Application
Crime rate prediction has become an important tool for law enforcement agencies to help them better understand patterns of crime and anticipate where crime is likely to occur. By predicting future crime trends, agencies can better allocate resources to areas expected to experience increased criminal activity. This can lead to a decrease in crime overall and enhance public safety. Additionally, predictive insights help in forming better response strategies to ongoing crimes.
The dataset is manually prepared using statistics from the Indian National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), covering the years 2014 to 2021 for 19 Indian metropolitan cities. The application can predict crime rates for 10 different crime categories expected in the coming years.

📊 Crime Categories:
Murder
Kidnapping
Crime Against Women
Crime Against Children
Crime Committed by Juveniles
Crime Against Senior Citizens
Crime Against SC
Crime Against ST
Economic Offences
Cyber Crimes

The backend uses Random Forest Regression from scikit-learn, which is an ensemble learning method that improves prediction accuracy by averaging outputs of multiple decision trees. The model achieves an accuracy of 93.20% on the testing dataset.
